# brian's Standard Configuration for Perl 6 Modules on Travis CI

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) is a continuous integration service for Linux and macOS. I test my [public Perl modules](https://github.com/briandfoy) on it and those modules often have the same Travis configuration. This repository versions that common file.

I have similar repostories:

* [Travis CI for Perl 5](https://github.com/briandfoy/brians_perl_modules_travis_config)
* [AppVeyor for Perl 5 Modules](https://github.com/briandfoy/brians_perl_modules_appveyor_config)
* [AppVeyor for Perl 6 Modules](https://github.com/briandfoy/brians_perl6_modules_appveyor_config)

And sometimes I write about these things:
